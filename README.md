# PizzeriaCirillo-App üçï
Imagine you are hungry. Open this app, order what you like and pay (Restaurant app demo).

This is a little project about an imaginary pizzeria that requested me an app. On the main page there are cards of the food categories that you can order and a button to see your bill.
Tapping on one of them you can read the menu an order what you like. Finally, tap the button and it will appear a medium sheet where you can visualize yor bill or modify your order. 
Code written in Xcode using SwiftUI. Very simple project but effective.
